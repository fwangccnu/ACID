# ACID
 Auto in silico Consensus Inverse Docking(ACID) is a free web server(http://acidtool.cn) mainly for drug repurposing based on the consensus inverse docking method, which is designed to evaluate the binding affinities between each protein and the given small molecule. ACID is open to the public and shows great potential.
# Dependencies
ACID was mainly developed using Perl(control the whole consensus inverse docking protocol) and PHP(Web server and database) on CentOS.Seven docking softwares were carefully evaluated to build consensus strategy, including AUTODOCK , VINA , DOCK , PLANTS , PSOVINA , LEDOCK and GOLD. 
# Datasets
All datasets of this study can be downloaded from the download page of the free web server http://acidtool.cn.

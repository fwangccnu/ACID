#
#   mm_pbsa allows to calculate (absolute) free energies for one molecular
#     species or a free energy difference according to:
#
#     Receptor + Ligand = Complex, 
#     DeltaG = G(Complex) - G(Receptor) - G(Ligand).

#            generation of snapshots as well as during mm_pbsa calculations.
#   PATH - Specifies the location where to store or get snapshots.
#
#   COMPLEX - Set to 1 if free energy difference is calculated.

@DECOMP 
#
# Energy decomposition parameters (this section is only relevant if DC = 1 above)
#
#   Energy decomposition is performed for gasphase energies, desolvation free
#     energies calculated with GB, and nonpolar contributions to desolvation
#     using the LCPO method.
#   For amino acids, decomposition is also performed with respect to backbone 
#     and sidechain atoms.
#
#   DCTYPE - Values of 1 or 2 yield a decomposition on a per-residue basis,
#            values of 3 or 4 yield a decomposition on a pairwise per-residue
#               basis. For the latter, so far the number of pairs must not 
#               exceed the number of residues in the molecule considered.
#            Values 1 or 3 add 1-4 interactions to bond contributions.
#            Values 2 or 4 add 1-4 interactions to either electrostatic or vdW 
#              contributions.
#
#   COMREC - Residues belonging to the receptor molecule IN THE COMPLEX.
#   COMLIG - Residues belonging to the ligand molecule IN THE COMPLEX.
#   RECRES - Residues in the receptor molecule.
#   LIGRES - Residues in the ligand molecule.
#   {COM,REC,LIG}PRI - Residues considered for output.
#   {REC,LIG}MAP - Residues in the complex which are equivalent to the residues
#                  in the receptor molecule or the ligand molecule.

@PB
#
# PB parameters (this section is only relevant if PB = 1 above)
#
#   The following parameters are passed to the PB solver. 
#   Additional parameters (e.g. SALT) may be added here. 
#   For further details see the delphi and pbsa documentation.
#
#   PROC - Determines which method is used for solving the PB equation:
#          If PROC = 1, the delphi program is applied. If PROC = 2,
#           the pbsa program of the AMBER suite is used.
#   REFE - Determines which reference state is taken for PB calc:
#          If REFE = 0, reaction field energy is calculated with EXDI/INDI.
#            Here, INDI must agree with DIELC from MM part.
#          If REFE > 0 && INDI > 1.0, the difference of total energies for 
#            combinations EXDI,INDI and 1.0,INDI is calculated. 
#            The electrostatic contribution is NOT taken from sander here.
#   INDI - Dielectric constant for the molecule.
#   EXDI - Dielectric constant for the surrounding solvent.
#   SCALE - Lattice spacing in no. of grids per Angstrom.
#   LINIT - No. of iterations with linear PB equation.
#   PRBRAD - Solvent probe radius in A (e.g. use 1.4 with the PARSE parameter set
#     and 1.6 with the radii optimized by R. Luo)
#
#   Parameters for pbsa only
#
#   RADIOPT - Option to set up atomic cavity radii for molecular surface
#     calculation and dielectric assignment. A value of 0 uses the cavity 
#     radii from the prmtop file.  A value of 1 sets up optimized cavity 
#     radii at the pbsa initialization phase.  The latter radii are optimized 
#     for model compounds of proteins only; use caution when applying 
#     these radii to nucleic acids.
#
#   Parameters for delphi only
#
#   FOCUS - If FOCUS > 0, subsequent (multiple) PERFIL and SCALE parameters are 
#     used for multiple delphi calculations using the focussing technique. 
#     The # of _focussing_ delphi calculations thus equals the value of FOCUS.
#   PERFIL - Percentage of the lattice that the largest linear dimension of the 
#            molecule will fill.
#   CHARGE - Name of the charge file.
#   SIZE - Name of the size (radii) file.
#
#   SURFTEN / SURFOFF - Values used to compute the nonpolar contribution Gnp to
#                  the desolvation according to Gnp = SURFTEN * SASA + SURFOFF.
